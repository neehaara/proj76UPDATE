    Up above you can see the order of the Sun,earth and moon during a solar eclipse. SME
    If theres a solar eclipse going on you look at the sun, with special glasses so you dont BURN your retina
     A solar eclipse happens when the moon passes beetween the sun and earth!

        Up above you can see the order of the Sun,earth and moon during a lunar eclipse. SEM.
        If theres a lunar eclipse going on you look at the moon, with your naked eye, its fine.
        A lunar eclipse happens when the earth gets in beetween the sun and the moon

    <h6>More On Eclipses:</h6>
    <h7>
        Hint:The word 'eclipse' means an obscuring of thhe light from one celestial body. So, solar eclipse sun(sol in latin) is eclipsed, lunar eclipse moon(luna in latin) is eclipsed
        <br>
        Note: We see lunar eclipses much more often than solar eclipses. ITs bc earth is so much bigger than moon, the entire nightime side can  see lunar eclipse
        <br>
        however, during a solar eclipse the sun is a lot bigger than moon, e.g: only this part can see the eclipse
        <img src="sol.jpg">
        <br>
        5 facts:
        <br> 1.The orbit for the moon and earth is tilted 
        <br>
        <img src="tilted_orbit.jpg">
        and the orbit of earth and sun is straight, so only when its in this position an eclipse happens
        <br>
        <img src="straight_orbit.jpg">
        <br> 
        2. If 2 Lunar eclipses happen during the same year they are 177 days apart approx.
        <br>
        3.there are 60 TOTAL solar and +TOTAL lunar eclipses that happen every century
        <br>
       4
       . If you were on the moon a solar eclipse would be a lunar eclipse, you would see the sun go away, from ur POV thats a lunar eclipse. and from earth we would see an obscured sun
       <br>
       5. the next total solar eclipse is on december 4th this year! But you have to go to antartica to see it
